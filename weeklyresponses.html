      <h1>Week 1: Catherine D’Ignazio: 'Data is never a raw, truthful input – and it is never neutral'</h1>
      <p>This interview was very topical for me personally.</p>
      <p>Regularly in my day job, I work with data.</p>
      <p>An everyday responsibility of mine is to adjust processes, analyze, and present this data to stakeholders in such
         a way that it is consistent with past reporting, truthful, and correct.
      </p>
      <p>However, that is often not a tenable task as I am a relatively new addition to the team, and over the years data
         collection, processing, analysis, and presentation methodologies have changed in fairly drastic ways, resulting
         in highly fuzzy data that paints a splotchy mess of a picture when expanded over time
      </p>
      <p>For example, the way demographic data has, as it should, evolved. 5 years ago the options for people to self
         identify their gender was either "Male", "Female", or "Non-binary". Now, we're tracking 10 different selections,
         in any combination.
      </p>
      <p>In my short experience with it, this medium sized organization collecting data has managed to show me everything
         Catherine warns about in her interview. Of her main points:
      </p>
      <h3>Data is never a raw, truthful input:</h3>
      <p>Often I reach out to members of the community asking for updates on how they are doing. While this is a
         "mandatory" data request, often times we don't receive everyone's response for a variety of reasons; they are
         embrassed by their answers, they simply miss it, or they are too busy to take the time to reply.
      </p>
      <h3>Data is not objective or universal:</h3>
      <p>As mentioned above, the way we collect demographic data has changed over the years. This is a good thing, but it
         makes it very difficult to compare data from 5 years ago to data from today. Alongside that, the way data is
         presented changes greatly dependent on the receiving audience. Percentage changes here, word choice of
         explanations, and more. These things change the meaning of data subjectively.
      </p>
      <h3>Data can be used be used for good, but it can also be used for bad:</h3>
      <p>While not happening in my organization, a fear I have for changes organizations as a whole make for tracking
         demographic data that is higher definition for 'othered' peoples is only being tracked for things such as
         marketing. To make the organization 'look good'.
      </p>
      <h3>Data feminism's practices</h3>
      <p>What Catherine brings up, and what data feminism underscores, is that we need to be more thoughtful about our
         approaches to data. This involves critically evaluating who is represented, who is doing the representing, and
         for what purpose.
      </p>
      <p>It's a much-needed perspective shift, one that puts an emphasis on justice and equity while acknowledging the
         emotional and human costs of data. So whether it's updating demographic options or being transparent about how
         and why data is collected, a feminist approach provides a holistic framework for ethical decision-making in data
         science.

      <h1>Week 3: The Interplay of Crowdsourcing and Collective Digital Artistry</h1>
      <p>"When Pixels Collide" resonated deeply with my professional experiences.</p>
      <p>Just as I grapple with data's fluidity in my job, this article showcased the fluid nature of collective digital creation.</p>
      <p>My role often involves presenting data consistently and truthfully, a task made challenging by evolving methodologies. Similarly, Reddit's "Place" experiment, as depicted in the article, was a dynamic canvas, shaped and reshaped by countless contributors.</p>
      <p>For instance, the way crowdsourcing has evolved mirrors how demographic data has expanded in granularity over time. What was once a simple task now requires nuanced understanding and interpretation.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on Jeff Howe's "The Rise of Crowdsourcing", I see parallels:</p>
      <h3>Crowdsourcing as a Democratic Tool:</h3>
      <p>Just as I've seen data collection methodologies change, crowdsourcing has evolved from a simple concept to a complex tool for collaboration and creation.</p>
      <h3>Challenges in Quality and Consistency:</h3>
      <p>Similar to my struggles with presenting consistent data over time, crowdsourced projects like "Place" grapple with maintaining quality amidst diverse contributions.</p>
      <h3>The Potential for Misuse:</h3>
      <p>While I worry about data being used superficially to enhance an organization's image, crowdsourcing too can be misused, as seen with destructive groups like "The Void".</p>
      <h3>A Call for Ethical Practices:</h3>
      <p>Both the articles emphasize the need for ethical practices. Whether it's ensuring data represents everyone fairly or ensuring crowdsourced projects are inclusive and respectful, there's a shared call for responsibility and care.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, these readings underscore the importance of approaching digital tools and methodologies with a critical and ethical lens, always considering the broader implications of our actions.</p>
