    <h1>Week 1: Catherine D’Ignazio: 'Data is never a raw, truthful input – and it is never neutral'</h1>
    <p>This interview was very topical for me personally.</p>
    <p>Regularly in my day job, I work with data.</p>
    <p>An everyday responsibility of mine is to adjust processes, analyze, and present this data to stakeholders in such
        a way that it is consistent with past reporting, truthful, and correct.</p>
    <p>However, that is often not a tenable task as I am a relatively new addition to the team, and over the years data
        collection, processing, analysis, and presentation methodologies have changed in fairly drastic ways, resulting
        in highly fuzzy data that paints a splotchy mess of a picture when expanded over time</p>
    <p>For example, the way demographic data has, as it should, evolved. 5 years ago the options for people to self
        identify their gender was either "Male", "Female", or "Non-binary". Now, we're tracking 10 different selections,
        in any combination.</p>
    <p>In my short experience with it, this medium sized organization collecting data has managed to show me everything
        Catherine warns about in her interview. Of her main points:</p>
    <h3>Data is never a raw, truthful input:</h3>
    <p>Often I reach out to members of the community asking for updates on how they are doing. While this is a
        "mandatory" data request, often times we don't receive everyone's response for a variety of reasons; they are
        embrassed by their answers, they simply miss it, or they are too busy to take the time to reply.</p>
    <h3>Data is not objective or universal:</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, the way we collect demographic data has changed over the years. This is a good thing, but it
        makes it very difficult to compare data from 5 years ago to data from today. Alongside that, the way data is
        presented changes greatly dependent on the receiving audience. Percentage changes here, word choice of
        explanations, and more. These things change the meaning of data subjectively.</p>
    <h3>Data can be used be used for good, but it can also be used for bad:</h3>
    <p>While not happening in my organization, a fear I have for changes organizations as a whole make for tracking
        demographic data that is higher definition for 'othered' peoples is only being tracked for things such as
        marketing. To make the organization 'look good'.</p>
    <h3>Data feminism's practices</h3>
    <p>What Catherine brings up, and what data feminism underscores, is that we need to be more thoughtful about our
        approaches to data. This involves critically evaluating who is represented, who is doing the representing, and
        for what purpose.</p>
    <p>It's a much-needed perspective shift, one that puts an emphasis on justice and equity while acknowledging the
        emotional and human costs of data. So whether it's updating demographic options or being transparent about how
        and why data is collected, a feminist approach provides a holistic framework for ethical decision-making in data
        science.</p>
